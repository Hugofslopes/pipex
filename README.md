    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        The program receives 4 arguments and it will store on the last argument (one file) the result of the commands
         defined on argument 2 and 3. The argument number 4 does not need to exist because the program is able to 
         create it. This behavior is the same as bash.
    </p>
    <h2>Improvements</h2>
    <p>
        The improvements to be made are to accept multiple pipes and handle more input errors, like the case of 
        unset PATH before running the program.
