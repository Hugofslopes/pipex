# Pipex

**Summary**
The program receives 4 arguments and it will store on the last argument (one file) the result of the commands defined on argument 2 and 3. The argument number 4 does not need to exist because the program is able to create it. This behavior is the same as bash.

**Improvements**  
The improvements to be made are to accept multiple pipes and handle more input errors, like the case of unset PATH before running the program.
