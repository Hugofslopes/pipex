## Summary
<html>
    <p>
    Pipex is an 42 School project wich has the goal to learn how to create pipes like bash terminal.
    The program receives 4 arguments. 1st is one file, second and third are bash comands like "ls, grep, ..."  and the number four other file. The argument number 4 does not need to exist because the program is able to creat it. This program should behave the same as bash :</p> <b>$> < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2" </b>

</html>

    make

<html>
    <p>
    <b>Step 3-</b> Execute:
    </p>
</html>

    ./pipex <file1> "comand1" "comand2" <file2>

<html>
    <p>
    <b>Step</b> 4- Run tests:

## Improvements
    
<html>
    <p>
    The improvements to be made are to accept multiple pipes and handle more input errors, like the case where you unset PATH before running the program.
